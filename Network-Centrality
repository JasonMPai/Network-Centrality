Library and import data
```{R}
library(readr)
library(igraph)
library(ggplot2)

TwiSub <- read.graph("twitter_graph_subset.txt", format = "ncol", directed = TRUE)
TwiCom <- read.graph("twitter_graph_complete.txt", format = "ncol", directed = TRUE)

Alpha centrality is implemented in igraph library for network analysis and visualization

```{R}
plot(TwiSub, edge.arrow.size=3,vertex.size = 6, vertex.label = NA)
```
Alpha Centrality
Alpha centrality is a measure of centrality of nodes. Improving upon eigenvector centrality with the addition that nodes, alpha centrality adds external data sources into the graph.  

```{R}
AlpCen = alpha_centrality(TwiSub, nodes = V(TwiSub))

for (i in c("0", "1", "2", "3", "940", "1147", "48526", "6497", "18719", "52513")) {
    print(paste("Aplha Centrality", i, ":", AlpCen[i]))}
```

Page Rank
PageRank producess the product of the quantity and quality of the network to a page to define the importance of the website. The values are given below:
```{R}
PageRank = page.rank(TwiCom)$vector

for (i in c("0", "1", "2", "3", "940", "1147", "48526", "6497", "18719", "52513")) {
    print(paste("Page Rank ", i, ":", PageRank[i]))
}
```

In-Degree
In Degree is represented by the number of edges incoming to a vertex. 
```{R}
InDeg = degree(TwiCom, v = V(TwiCom), mode = "in")

for (i in c("0", "1", "2", "3", "940", "1147", "48526", "6497", "18719", "52513")) {
    print(paste("In-Degree ", i, ":", InDeg[i]))
}
```

Defining the In-Degree axis (X) and the Page Rank (Y) axis
- From trial and error, we will utilize log scale to make the chart more informative
```{R}

InDeg[c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)]
PageRank[c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)]

DataFrame1 = data.frame(InDeg, PageRank)
DataFrame1$log_PageRank = log(DataFrame1$PageRank)
DataFrame1$log_InDeg = log(DataFrame1$InDeg)

graph1 = ggplot(DataFrame1, aes(x = log_InDeg, y = log_PageRank)) + geom_point(colour = "grey") + stat_smooth(color = "black")
graph1 + ggtitle("Twitter: In-degree vs Page Rank") + ylab("Log(Page Rank)") + 
    xlab("Log(In-Degree)")
```

Observation:
From the chart above measuring the log of bothe the Page Rank vs the In Degree, we see a positive correlation between the two variables. In theory, nodes with In-Degree higher than zero should all have a higher Page Rank than nodes with In-Degree equal to zero.  As In-Degree increases, Page Rank increases (trend line shown in Red line). Within the dataset, we can see that there are pockets of higher In-Degree.  Accordingly, these nodes have a corresponding value of high Page Rank values, as well.
